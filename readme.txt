= How it works (3 Easy Steps) =

1. **Install this plugin** - Set up a few basic settings
2. **Upload your artwork** - Upload one or more artworks to create collections of products. Once uploaded we will populate your artwork across the entire product range, including prices, descriptions and more. You can then tweak the artwork to match your own taste before publishing your store. The cost of the product and shipping will be clearly stated.
3. **Click publish and relax!** - Your work is done. We'll start fulfilling the orders of your linked products as they come in.

= Need more assistance? =

Unsure about anything? Chat to us using the live chat within the plugin or drop us an email at **[support@kite.ly](mailto:support@kite.ly)**. We'll be happy to help!

== Data sent to our servers ==

We keep this to a minimum, basically only things we need to provide an automated drop shipping service to you:

* We query our servers to get details on our full product range, this includes up to date pricing information, etc. This query does not include any of your information outside of your currency preference.
* Images that you upload in the plugin to create products are uploaded to our servers. This is so that we can optimise rendering of the product photography whilst still having access to the raw uncompressed uploaded image that we'll use to print on your products.
* Due to the nature of this plugin, any WooCommerce orders containing items that we (Kite) need to fulfil on your behalf need to get sent to our server (otherwise we can't print and ship them to your customers). This means we need to send the customer shipping address & product details for printing. Orders that don't contain Kite items are not sent to our servers. 
* In order to use this plugin you need a Kite.ly account. For the best user experience we will automatically create you one as part of the plugin usage - this requires your email address. 
* We have a live chat widget in the plugin to provide support, the widget is provided by intercom.io. Based on our experience launching similar plugins on other e-commerce platforms, we typically receive hundreds of customer service queries per day. Intercom provides a live chat widget that appears on the page that we use to handle this customer service in a scalable manner and also provide the best experience to our users. If you don't want customer support feel free to comment out or remove the script tags associated with intercom.io - theyâ€™re called out appropriately in index.php.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `kite-print-and-dropshipping-on-demand/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Do I need to have WooCommerce installed to use the plugin? =

Yes, WooCommerce is required for the plugin to work. 

= Problems with displaying product images =

Below are two technical answers on how to get your theme working, but you can also "freeze" your products, which downloads their images to your Media library (thus removing the reliance on themes to replace these images on the fly).

Please note that product images of "frozen" products cannot be edited unless the product is "unfrozen". Also, "freezing" takes quite a bit of time (usually around 10 minutes or more, depending on your network connection, for the full range of products).

= The page for adding products doesn't show in my Safari =

There is a known bug in older Safaris. Please upgrade to version 10+.

= My theme or some plugin overrides product images back to placeholder image and I found where this happens. How do I fix this? =

There is a convenience function `wookite_process_image($html, $post_id)` which accepts either HTML code or an image URL as the first argument and the variant or product's `post_id` as the second, and returns the version of the HTML/URL with Kite's placeholder image URL replaced with proper image links.

= Why are my product images not showing in Oxygen theme? =

Oxygen forces local thumbnails with no filters/actions to latch to, so our plugin cannot override it. A simple fix is to open `oxygen/woocommerce/single-product/add-to-cart/variable.php` and replace

    $image = wp_get_attachment_image_src( get_post_thumbnail_id( $variation['variation_id'] ), 'shop-thumb-4' );

with

    $image = wookite_process_image(
        wp_get_attachment_image_src( get_post_thumbnail_id( $variation['variation_id'] ), 'shop-thumb-4' ),
        $variation['variation_id']
    );

A similar fix can work on other themes, as long as you can provide the original image URL (here generated by the `wp_get_attachment_image_src` call) and variation's ID (here given as `$variation['variation_id']`).

= Why are my product images showing Kite logo instead of the actual image? =

This used to be issue until version 1.0.3. This answer is left here for anyone needing it for older versions.

That image is used as a placeholder that is substituted for the actual image, in order to significantly improve the performance of the plugin. However, it also relies on a properly written theme.

Specifically, for storefront product images, in the file `woocommerce/single-product/product-image.php in your theme's directory, there must be a call similar to this one:

    echo apply_filters(
        'woocommerce_single_product_image_html',
        sprintf(
            '<a href="%s" itemprop="image" class="woocommerce-main-image zoom" title="%s" data-rel="prettyPhoto%s">%s</a>',
            esc_url( $props['url'] ),
            esc_attr( $props['caption'] ),
            $gallery,
            $image
        ),
        $post->ID
    );

If there isn't one, you can find the part that is generating the image (in the above code, it is the whole `sprintf(...)` part, but it can also be just `<img src="..." ... />` or something similar) and enclose it in the `echo apply_filters('woocommerce_single_product_image_html', ...)` call.

For other images, there should be similar calls to `apply_filters` in your theme's `woocommerce` directory:

* filter `woocommerce_single_product_image_thumbnail_html` in `single-product/product-thumbnails.php` for product thumbnails,

* filter `woocommerce_cart_item_thumbnail` for product images in carts, in `cart/cart.php`,

* filter `woocommerce_before_subcategory_title` for range category images in `content-product_cat.php`.
